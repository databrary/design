# Top Level Dataset/Study Information 

The purpose of this document is to gather some information from you about your dataset or study to enter into Databrary. We want you, the researcher, to drive the way your data are represented. We also want to make sure your data are presented in a way that makes sense to other people viewing your data, and that your research is presented in the best possible light. We believe the way to do this is to use descriptive titles and language, instead of terms that are idiosyncratic and specific to your lab group.

While you are filling this out, please think about what your participants were doing, what actions were taking place in the most basic of terms. Also think about what the most important things about your data are.  

In addition, feel free to attach any files that describe the entire dataset or study. These could be images, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, blank consent forms, or any other files you might have that you are willing to share. 

Keep in mind that most of this information, especially the sharing portion, is easy to change. Before we make your data visible to the Databrary community, we will go through your dataset(s) on Databrary with you to ensure you are satisfied with the way your research looks.

##Titles and Summaries

Please provide a title for your dataset. We would like it to be a descriptive title. Think about what the most important aspect of your dataset is. Is it the task? Physical description? Display? Technique? You can think about it and come back to this question after filling out the rest of the worksheet.

Write a summary of your dataset or study. This can be similar to an abstract in a published paper. Some researchers write a couple sentences, others write long paragraphs.

Did you derive multiple projects or questions from this data or pool multiple sources of data to perform this study? Yes or no? If yes, we will have a more in depth conversation with you about how to represent that data.

What is your collection methodology? Can you define what you did? This can be similar to the methods section in a published paper.

Did you use any stimuli, like videos or images? Can you send us those stimuli?

What did the subjects do in a single session? Were there specific tasks that each participant attempted? Can you give descriptive names to the tasks?

Do you have documentation that defines specifically what the participants did for each task or over a session? These could be instructions given to a participant or protocols. You can attach that documentation to this worksheet. If you do not have that documentation, could you please define what a participant did for each task and/or in a session?

##Defining what kind of data this is

What kind of dataset or study is this? Is it longitudinal, where you kept track of the same participants over time? Did you keep the same subject IDs? 

What stage is this data in? Maybe this is pilot data you collected while refining your process. We would like you to feel comfortable sharing datasets you didn't end up using for whatever reason. Your discarded data might be useful to another researcher. 

Or is it data from a published study? Is it from a study that is still in in progress? 

Did you have excluded participants and how would you like those excluded participants to be represented? For what reasons would you exclude participants? 

Over what time period did you collect this data?

Where did you collect this data? In a variety of places and/or settings or one location/setting? 

Was there a specific population you were studying? 

Did you have randomly assigned conditions or treatments within or between subjects? How would you define these these conditions or treatments?

Did you do groupings by age/gender/experience etc? How would you define these groupings?
