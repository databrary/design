#Data Conversations

We think of this document as set of notes on the curation process and welcome comments and feedback about the ideas that follow.
The intention is for this to lead to a document that explicitly details the curation process: what conversations will we have with contributors and what information we will solicit from them in what order.
It will provide a guide for contributors as well as curators to prepare them for how the process will go.

###Summary of information we will gather

* The primary focus or "subjects" of a researcher's data: individual participants, families, classrooms, crowds, animals, etc.
* Information the researcher is already collecting or plans to collect about these subjects, ideally including some representation of age (birthdate, rough age, grade level, etc.), demographics, etc.
* What level of sharing applicable release forms may warrant
* The primary mode of data collection: presumably video, but may include other measurements, multiple camera views, eye tracking, paper records, assessments, etc.
* Conditions of data acquisition: homogeneous, multiple condition or treatment groups, longitudinal or other repeated acquisitions, case studies, or other meaningful groupings
* Cases of non-representative or preliminary data, pilot data, and how the researcher feels these relate to their primary data, if at all
* Reasons for exceptional, partial, withdrawn, excluded, missing, or other data excluded from analyses, and to what extent the researcher wishes to include these with their primary data, if at all
* Any other ways the researcher organizes, distinguishes, or identifies their data
* Other supporting materials the researcher wishes to share besides videos
* Whom to contact for inquiries and further conversations

## Permissible Data

For these purposes, we are assuming that Lisa has worked with the contributor to determine what datasets/studies have permissions that allow sharing. These could be data previously collected with language their IRB deemed equivalent with Databrary sharing or data collected with the **Databrary Release**. The policy conversations have to come first, and will allow us (Lisa) to explain that the release form can come at the end of the session and is totally separate from the consent process. 

### Action items for researcher

- Where and in what form are their consent forms? 
	- Databrary/Lisa can review and advise.
- Is language on consent or release forms be approved by their home IRB? 
- What level of sharing do these forms warrant? 
	- Lisa can help them to compare the sharing levels in Databrary with their consent/release language, **BUT**
	- PI/Contributor must make the determination about what they want to warrant
- How is the permission level information stored and what is the best way for us to compile that information? *This may be postponed until later in the process.*

## Introduction and initial conversation

Our main goal here is to get an idea of what data the contributor collects and how they think about organizing it.

We might lead with something like:
> We know data sharing is new and how hard it is to keep everything organized consistently. We expect that not everything we will ask for has already been collated, organized, or digitized. We want to think with you about all the important information you want to pull out of your data and store in Databrary. We will work with you throughout the process, and also advise about best practices you might adopt that will make this process easier for data you acquire going forward.
>
> To start thinking about this process, can you tell me about some research you have done on data that you may be able to share, perhaps a paper you've published.
> What data went into this research?
>
> Can you show me where your data is and how you organize your videos and your other files? Can you explain what different files you have and how you name them, perhaps including videos, any lists of participants, procedure or analysis manuals or protocols, coding spreadsheets.

We can then explain how Databrary is organized and talk to the PI about how their data fits:

> Databrary has been designed so that the most basic unit of organization is a *session*. We consider a session to be a specific period of time when data is collected from a participant or participants, such as a single visit.
> Sessions are like folders that contain all the raw data collected during this visit, including videos, survey responses, or other measurements or observations.
> For each session we will need to know the **sharing release level** that applies, and would very much like to know the **specific date** on which the session was collected, if possible.
>
> We then collect sessions into a *dataset*, which is just a way for you to collect and find related sessions, and can be however large or small you wish, depending on how much data you wish to share with other people at the same time.
> 
> Once you have one or more datasets, we can create what we call a *study* to represent the research product you described earlier.
> This study is what people will see when browsing your data.
> Here we can indicate which sessions were included, and for each one add any other files about the analyses you did, such as video coding spreadsheets, SPSS data files, etc.
> We can also add other files with aggregate data, manuals or source code ("syntax") used to perform these analyses, figures, references or links to publications or other resources, or anything else you want.

Some sample questions:

> - Can you describe a typical session?
> - Do you have some data you might collect into a dataset?
> - Do you have one or more studies you wish to share?
> - About how many (participants/households/etc.) are included in your dataset?
> - Do you have pilot participants? Would you want those included on databrary with your dataset? Or as a seperate dataset?
> - Do you exclude any participants? Why? Would you want these included on databrary with your study?
> - What ways, if any, do you have of grouping participants/sessions? Ex: tasks, locations, age group, etc.
> - Do you have any multi-visit or longitudinal studies where you keep track of the same participants?
> - Do you have videos with multiple participants?
> - Do you have videos with multiple tasks/tests?
> - Do you collect data in different locations? What locations?

### Data about participants

Then we want to learn what information the PI collects about the participants and the sessions, where they might already have that information recorded electronically, and what information is important for them.

Types of information researcher might have about participants:
   - age: ideally as a birthdate per participant, but otherwise we can see what they collect already, be it a rough age, grade level, or other aggregate measure
   - gender: M/F other other categories?
   - race: using NIH categories (American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; Black or African American; White; Multiple) or something else?
   - ethnicity: using NIH categories (Not Hispanic or Latino; Hispanic or Latino) or something else?
   - language: first language, spoken at home, self-reported, multiple, fixed set?
   - location: of origin, current, how specific (country, zip, etc.). *We should not collect more specific locations that state.*
   - SES: what scale, examples

> Is there other data you collect about participants that is important for your work or potentially helpful to someone re-purposing your data?

### Collecting data

> - Where do you currently keep that participant-level information? Is it compiled in one file/location or across several files/locations? Is any of it on paper and has never been entered into a digital format?
> - What other information do you collect?
> - What information do you have about your data this is important to you?
> - Do you have standardized forms of description or metadata?
> - Are the labels or terms you use sufficient for another person with similar expertise to understand and use your data?

Now we want to learn what kinds of files the researcher has and might want to share.

> - Once your data is collected, what do you do with it? What do you consider raw data?
> - What format(s) are your videos in and how did they get to that format?
> - What other kinds of files do you use or produce and in what formats?
> - What important components of your data or analyses do you want to share on Databrary?
> - What other files do you want to share that describe your data that would be useful to other researchers?
> - Do you have procedure manuals? Could you show me a typical manual? Is this something you'd be willing to share?
> - What do you use to score and analyze your video? Can you show me a typical coding manual/coding spreadsheet? Is this something you'd be willing to share?
> - What data from what stages would you be willing to share and with whom?

Here are some examples of other materials that researchers might have.

- Analysis Material (e.g. coding, syntax files, spss files, etc)
- Supplementary Materials (e.g. coding manuals, blank questionnaires, protocols, measures, etc)
- Raw Data (e.g. videos, filled-out questionnaires, etc)
- Other (please define)

> - What tools – software or hardware – are used to generate your data? How?
> - What tools - software or hardware - are required to use your data? How? Is this tool needed by others to make use of your data?
> - When would you be willing to share your data? Immediately? After the results are published?

Procure extra information about how dataset should look and be represented in Databrary.

> - What keywords might you use to search for your own data in Databrary?
> - Do you have pictures or images you want to add to your data? Or should we pull thumbnails from your videos?
> - Would you be willing to provide a descriptive title and a two or three sentence description of your dataset(s) that we can post on Databrary? You can think about this and send it later, and we can always change it.
> - What preparations or actions, if any, would need to take place before your data could be shared with Databrary? Ex: reviewing/proofreading the data, scrubbing the data for identifying information
> - What is the next step we need to take to share your data?
> - Are there any relevant documents or publications that would help me better understand your data?
> - Are there other things about your research you’d like to share? Let’s talk about it. We can expound on your videos, what you scored, your coding manual, etc.

### Meta-Survey

Set up the ongoing communication process throughout the collection and ingest of data

> - We will be checking in with you as we upload your data into Databrary. What level of involvement do you want with your data organization?
> - Once we upload data, would you like to upload more docs or organize your data further yourself, or is that something you'd like us to do for you with your guidance?
> - Do you want to be the contact person for your lab? Or do you want to appoint someone to be your liaison?

Gather information about how the PI manages their data (optional)

> - How do you currently manage your data?
> - Do you back up your data? How and how often?
> - Do you take any security measures to protect your data?

Ask the PI about their thoughts on Databrary (optional)

> - What made you decide to deposit your data into Databrary?
> - Are there any services in particular you want Databrary to provide?
> - Do you have any concerns about sharing your data in Databrary?
> - When you imagine uploading your data in Databrary, what do you envision the process to be like?

## Acquiring Data

- Create a customized spreadsheet (from template) for researcher reflecting their specific data and metadata
- Organize data transfer from their lab to our server
- Set up PI with Databrary account (Authorization) and show them how to sign in and view/edit/upload data on their own so they have that option if they want it
- Check in with PI as we upload data at every stage
- After initial data is uploaded on Databrary, present to PI for approval and make any changes the PI wants
