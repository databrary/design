Dear Rick,

I am delighted to participate in the "Making the Hidden Visible: Searching Within Video Data" project—your effort to create an open library of shared developmental science data based on the OpenSHAPA video coding tool.

Toward that end, I am committed to seeking IRB approval to permit open data sharing in my current and future studies. That application will be based on template consent language that is shaped by input from me and other members of the emerging community of scientists who share a commitment to open data-sharing. Please add my name to the list of “committed contributors” on the databrary.org website.

I am a current user of OpenSHAPA and look forward to working with your team to shape the tool’s development. I am also eager to see what kinds of data others contribute, and look forward to browsing the archive and helping you make this project succeed.
Sincerely,
