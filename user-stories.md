### Create supporting files for a study.

As an investigator (PI, postdoc, graduate student),
I want to be able to create and manage studies. Assigning graduate students and undergrads to collect and code data.

1. Create new study (this may often be done by a student/postdoc study lead)
2. Enter title, description
2. Add additional members (automatically added: user, PI parent as owner)  

As an investigator,
I want to be able to at a glance see how progress is being made towards completing a particular study.

1. Go to study page, linked from front page/dashboard to all owned studies (sort by date rev)
2. Displays acquisitions/subjects, ...  

As a principal investigator,
I want to be able to manage the accounts for all the people who work in my lab and have access to the data.

1. Go to member authorization page
2. Displays (nested) list of members, account renewal dates, and new requests for membership
3. ...  

As a principal investigator,
I want to be able to ensure that all data is stored and collected in accordance with IRB rules and regulations. 
* Does labnanny manage IRB protocols, expirations dates, etc. that can be added to a study?

As an investigator,
I want to be able to create collection protocols (procedures) and coding manuals.

1. Go to study page
2. Upload materials, consent forms, manuals
3. (Optional, unknown) Describe study schema, layout, interview questions, data types  
    * Drag-and-drop interface to describe "all the information that will be collected for each acquisition/subject/session"
    * Add data "containers" for participant information, video data, interview questions, measurements
    * Add analysis "containers" for coding spreadsheets

As an investigator, 
I want members of my research team to receive notifications when there are changes in my study protocol. 
Those reminders might also prompt me to consider whether I need to revise my formal IRB protocol.

### Work day to day collecting data.

As an investigator,
I want to be able to refine collection protocols (procedures), based on experience and pilot studies / participants. 
* This may involve editing study materials (documents) or design

As an experimenter,
I want to be able to add data for a new trial in a particular study. Adding details about consent, any demographic information as well as the raw video and sensor data.

1. Go to study page
2. Add acquisition
3. Fill in fields, automatically derived from study design and/or previous acquisitions
4. Upload data files, by web form or syncing application

As an experimenter,
I want to be able to be able to perform any post-processing (quad mixing, etc) to create completed datasets that need to be coded or marked up.
* Does this happen entirely in Datavyu?

### Work day to day coding study.

As an experimenter,
I want to be able to refine coding manuals, based on experience, ambiguities and inter-rater reliability of trials that have already been coded.

As a coder,
I want to be able to see what trials need to be coded (marked up) using datavyu.

As a coder,
I want to automatically create and download everything I need to start coding a new trial within a study.

1. Go to study page
2. Select acquisition
3. Download automatically-generated archive of all data

As a coder,
I want to be able to submit my coded data to be stored alongside the rest of a study.

As an investigator,
I want the coding activities of my lab members tracked and recorded so I can monitor progress of a study.

### Publish

As a researcher,
I want to publish written articles based on data collected for the study.

As an investigator,
I want to publish (share) datasets that are referenced in published articles. 

1. Go to study page
2. "Flip switch" to give public access  

As an investigator
I want to be able to cite datasets that have been shared with the wider community.

1. Find study
2. Look at/copy/export cite section of page (can choose from standard formats for export: RIS, bibtex, etc.)
